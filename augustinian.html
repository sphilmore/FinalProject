        <ol>
          <li>There are three possible accounts for the existence of abstract objects ( numbers, possible worlds, universals, and propositions, and mathematical objects) realism, nominalism, and conceptualism.</li>
          <li>There are decisive arguments in favor of realism.</li>
          <li>There are insuperable objections against nominalism.</li>
          <li>There are insuperable objections against conceptualism.</li>
          <li>So, some versions of realism is true.</li>
          <li>There are three possible versions of realism: Platonic realism, Aristotelian realism, Scholastic realism</li>
          <li>If Platonic realism is true, then abstract objects exist in a “third realm” distinct from either the material world or any intellect</li>
          <li>If Aristotelian realism is true, then abstract objects exist only in the human mind or other contingently existing intellects.</li>
          <li>If Scholastic realism is true, then abstract objects exist only in contingently existing intellects but also in at least one necessarily existing intellect. </li>
          <li>There are insuperable objections against the claim that abstract objects exist in a “third realm” distinct from either the material world or any intellect.</li>
          <li>There are insuperable objections against the claim that abstract objects exist only in human or other contingently existing intellects.</li>
          <li>So, Aristotelian realism is not true.</li>
          <li>So, Scholastic realism is true.</li>
          <li>So, abstract objects exist not only in contingently existing intellects but also in at least one necessarily existing intellect. </li>
          <li>Abstract objects such as universals, propositions, numbers and other mathematical objects; and possible worlds are logically related to one another in such a way that they form an interlocking systems of ideas. </li>
          <li>The reasons for concluding that at least some abstract objects exist in a necessarily existing intellect also entail that this interlocking system of ideas must exist in a necessarily existing intellect. </li>
          <li>So, this interlocking system of ideas exist in at least one necessarily existing intellect. </li>
          <li>A necessarily existing intellect would be purely actual.</li>
          <li>There cannot be more than one thing that is purely actual.</li>
          <li>So,there cannot be more than one necessarily existing intellect.</li>
          <li>An intellect in which the interlocking system of ideas in question existed would be conceptually omniscient.</li>
          <li>So, the one necessarily existing intellect is conceptually omniscient.</li>
          <li>If this one necessarily existing intellect were not also omniscient in the stronger sense that it knows all contingent truths, then it would have unrealized potential and this not be purely actual.</li>
          <li>So, it is also omniscient in the stronger sense</li>
          <li>What is purely actual must also be omnipotent, fully good, immutable, immaterial, incorporeal, and eternal.</li>
          <li>So, there is exactly one necessarily existing intellect, which is purely actual, omniscient, omnipotent, fully good, immutable, immaterial, incorporeal, and eternal. </li>
          <li>But for there to be such a thing is just what it is for God to exist.</li>
          <li>So, God exists. </li>

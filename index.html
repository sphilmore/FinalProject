  <h1>Weclome to the Philosopher's Corner</h1>
  <p>This week the topic will be about the existence of God from two perspectives classical theism and theistic personalism.</p>
  <h3>What is Classical Theism?</h3>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism#:~:text=Classical%20theism%20is%20a%20form,is%20a%20form%20of%20monotheism.">
    "Classical theism is a form of monotheism. Whereas most monotheists agree that God is, at minimum, all-knowing, all-powerful, and completely good, classical theism asserts that God is both immanent (encompassing or manifested in the material
    world) and simultaneously transcendent (independent of the material universe); simple, and having such attributes as immutability, impassibility, and timelessness. A key concept in classical theism is that "created beings" (ie, material
    phenomena, whether sentient biological organisms or insentient matter) are dependent for their existence on the one supreme divine Being."

  <h3>What is Theistic Personalism?</h3>
  <blockquote>
    "Theistic Personalism...essentially treats God as the unique member of a spcies falling under the genus person, alongside other species of persons like human beings and angels, and differing from them in lacking their limitations on power,
    knowledge, goodness, and so forth".

            <li>The things of our experience are composite.</li> <br>
            <li>A composite exists at any moment only insofar as its parts are combined at that moment.</li><br>
            <li>This composition of parts requires a concurrent cause.</li><br>
            <li>So, any composite has a cause of its existence at any moment at which it exists.</li><br>
            <li>So, each of the things of our experience has cause at any moment at which it exists.</li><br>
            <li>If the cause of a composite thing’s existence at any moment is itself composite, then it will in turn require a cause of its own existence at that moment.</li><br>
            <li>The regress of causes this entails is hierarchical in nature, and such a degree must have a first member.</li><br>
            <li>Only something absolutely simple of noncomposite could be the first member of such series.</li><br>
            <li>So, the existence of each of things of our experience presupposes an absolutely simple or noncomposite cause. </li><br>
            <li>In order for there to be more than absolutely one simple or noncomposite cause, each would have to have some differentiating feature that the others lacked.</li><br>
            <li>But for a cause to have such a feature would be for it to have parts, in which case it would not really be simple or noncomposite. </li><br>
            <li>So, no absolutely simple or noncomposite cause can have such a differentiating feature.</li><br>
            <li>So, there cannot be more than one absolutely simple or noncomposite cause. </li><br>
            <li>If the absolutely simple or noncomposite cause were changeable, then it would have parts which it gains or loses which being simple or noncomposite, it does not have. </li><br>
            <li>So, the absolutely simple or noncomposite cause is changeless or immutable.</li><br>
            <li>If the absolutely simple or noncomposite cause had a beginning or an end, it would have parts which could either be combined or broken apart. </li><br>
            <li>So, since it has no such parts, the absolutely simple or noncomposite cause is beginning and endless. </li><br>
            <li>Whatever is immutable, beginningless, and endless is eternal.</li><br>
            <li>So, the absolutely simple or noncomposite cause is eternal. </li><br>
            <li>If a composite is caused, then it has parts which need to be combined.</li><br>
            <li>So, the absolutely simple or noncomposite cause, since it has no parts, is uncaused.</li><br>
            <li>Everything is either a mind, or a mental content, or a material entity, or an abstract entity </li><br>
            <li>Abstract entity is causally inert.</li><br>
            <li>So, the absolutely simple or noncomposite cause, since it is not causally inert, is not an abstract entity.</li><br>
            <li>A material entity has parts and is changeable.</li><br>
            <li>So, the absolutely simple or noncomposite cause, since it is without parts and changeless, is not a material entity.</li><br>
            <li>A mental content presupposes the existence of a mind, and so cannot be the ultimate cause of anything.</li><br>
            <li>So, the absolutely simple or noncomposite cause, being the ultimate cause of things, cannot be a mental content.</li><br>
            <li>So, the absolutely simple or noncomposite cause must be a mind.</li><br>

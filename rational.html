    <li>The principle of sufficient reason (PSR) holds that there is an explanation for the existence of anything that does exist and for its having the attributes it has.</li> <br>
    <li>The explanation of the existence of anything is to be found either in some other thing which causes it, in which case it is contingent, or in its own nature, in which case it is necessary. PSR rules out any third alternative.</li><br>
    <li>There are contingent things.</li><br>
    <li>Even if the existence of an individual contingent thing could be explained by reference to some previously existing contingent thing, which in turn could be explained by a pervious member, and so to infinity, that the infinite series as a whole exists at all would remain to be explained.</li> <br>
    <li>To explain this series by reference to some further contingent cause outside the series, and then explain this cause in terms of some yet further contingent thing, and so on to infinity, would merely yield another series whose existence would remain to be explained and to posit yet another contingent thing outside this second series would merely generate the same problem yet again. </li><br>
    <li>So, no contingent thing or series of contingent things can explain why there are any contingent things at all. </li><br>
    <li>But that there are any contingent things at all must have some explanation, given PSR and the only remaining explanation is in terms of a necessary being as cause.</li><br>
    <li>Furthermore, that an individual contingent thing persists in existence at any moment requires an explanation and since it is contingent that explanation must lie in some simultaneous cause distinct from it.</li><br>
    <li>If this cause is itself contingent, then even if it has yet another contingent thing as it own simultaneous cause, and that cause yet another contingent thing as its simultaneous cause, and so on to infinity, then once again we have infinite series of contingent things the existence of which has yet to be explained.</li><br>
    <li>So, no contingent thing or series of contingent things can explain why any particular contingent thing persists in existence at any moment, and the only remaining explanation is terms of a necessary being as its simultaneous cause</li><br>
    <li>So, there must be at least one necessary being to explain why any contingent things exist at all and how any particular contingent thing persists in existence at any moment.</li> <br>
    <li>A necessary being would have to be purely actual, absolutely simple or noncomposite, and something which just is subsistent existence itself.</li><br>
    <li>But there can in principle be only one thing which is purely actual, absolutely simple or noncomposite, and something which is subsistent existence itself.</li><br>
    <li>So, there is only necessary being.</li> <br>
    <li>So, it is this same one necessary being explanation of why any contingent things exist at all and which is the cause of every particular contingent things existing at any moment.</li> <br>
    <li>So, this necessary being is the cause of everything other than itself.</li><br>
    <li>Something which is purely actual, absolutely simple or noncomposite, and something which just is subsistent existence itself must also be immutable, eternal, immaterial, incorporeal, perfect, omnipotent, fully good, intelligent, and omniscient.</li><br>
    <li>So, there is a necessary being which is one, purely actual, absolutely simple, subsistent existence itself, cause of everything other than itself, immutable, eternal, immaterial, incorporeal, perfect, omnipotent, fully good, intelligent, and omniscient.</li><br>
    <li>But for there to be such a thing is for God to exist.</li><br>
    <li>So, God exists.</li> <br>

          <li>For any of the things we know from experience (stones, trees, dogs, human beings, etc.), there is a distinction to be drawn between its essence and its existence.</li><br>
          <li>If this were not a real distinction-a distinction between aspects of reality itself and not merely between ways of thinking or talking about reality – then we could know whether or not a thing exits simply by knowing its essence.</li><br>
          <li>But we cannot know whether or not a thing exists simply by knowing its essence.</li><br>
          <li>If it were not a real distinction, then the things we know from experience would exist in a necessary way rather than in a merely contingent way. </li>
          <li>But in fact, they exist in a merely contingent way, and not in a necessary way. </li><br>
          <li>If there could in principle be more than one thing the essence of which is identical to its existence, then two or more such things would be distinguishable.  In the way that species of the same genus are distinguished, or members of the same species are distinguished, or in some other way. </li><br>
          <li>But they cannot be distinguished in any of these ways.</li> <br>
          <li>So, there could not in principle be more than one thing the essence of which is identical to its existence. </li><br>
          <li>So, for any of the things we know from experience, if the distinction between its essence and its existence were not a real distinction, then there could not in principle be more than one of them.</li>  <br>
          <li>But in fact, for each of the things we know from experience, there is, or could be, more than one of them.</li><br>
          <li>So, for each of the things we know from experience, the distinction between its essence and its existence is a real distinction. </li> <br>
          <li>For anything, the essence of which is really distinct from its existence, its existence must be imparted to it either by itself or by some cause distinct from it. </li> <br>
          <li>But if it imparted existence to itself, it would be the cause of itself. </li> <br>
          <li>Nothing can be the cause of itself.</li> <br>
          <li>So, it cannot impart existence to itself.</li> <br>
          <li>So, for anything the essence of which is really distinct from its existence, its existence must be imparted to it by some cause distinct from it.</li> <br>
          <li>Since its essence and existence remain really distinct at every moment at which it exists, including here and now, its existence must be imparted to it by some cause distinct from it at every moment at which it exists, including here and now. </li> <br>
          <li>So, for each of the things we know from experience, its existence must be imparted to it by some cause distinct from it at every moment at which it exists, including here and now.</li> <br>
          <li>If this cause is something the essence of which is distinct from its existence, then its own existence too must be imparted to it by some cause distinct from it at every moment at which it exists, including here and now.</li><br>
          <li>The causal series this would generate would be a hierarchical one, which cannot regress infinitely but must have a first member.</li> <br>
          <li>22.	The first member could only be something whose essence and existence are identical, something that just is subsistent existence itself. </li><br>
